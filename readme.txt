mini project for solve for the phase plane of a system of differential equations. 2D, maybe 3D if it is cool enough. Using integration methods to solve a system of DEs, probably using 2 or 3 numerical methods.
Should also plot vector field, and isoclines,

Similar to PPLANE, but animated and shit because why not. And written in c++



Things to make: 
	- static 2d plot (3d if im bored)
	- numerical integration methods that take in functions
	- plot vector field
	- dynamic plot (animate orbits as function of time)
		- draw individual orbits dynamically.
		- maybe with a collection of vectors that change length as function of time.
	- draw isoclines somehow. (idk)
		- probably gonna need to do implicit plotting of these (dunno how to do that yet)

Possible fun stuff to do:
	- use GPU to calculate this stuff (marginal increase for double precision, maybe not worth)

external dependencies:
	- SFML (probably), maybe opengl or SDL
	- boost program options.
		- maybe other boost stuff.
